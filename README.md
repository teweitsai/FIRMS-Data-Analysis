# Analyze the data by force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS)

A. Signal Analysis

The code, force analysis gui tk.py, is used to analyze the magnetic signal in measurements. In the beginning, it converts the unit of signal from the nano- ampere (nA) to pico-tesla (pT) by comparing with the reference signal from a function generator, which provides a stable 150 pT as the input signal through a Helmholtz coil. Then, all measurements are subtracted from the background signal to get the change of magnetic field. Finally, the measurement is corrected from the fluctuation of laser to get a clear signal. It can be seem as the magnetic field generated by a magnetic dipole moment to get the amount of magnetic particles with the specific interaction with the sample system.

The code, function MRI.py, contains the functions used in "force analysis gui tk.py".

B. File Splitter

The code, file preparation new.py, splits the measurement output from LabVIEW into files with individual experimental condition (i.e. lasting time, voltage, and frequency) when the piezoelectric material is the source of acoustic radiation force.
